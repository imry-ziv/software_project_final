general:
sym works both through python and through c
norm works both through python and through c

python failures that i think are due to c computations:
2 symnmf test_input_small4.txt (wrong output matrix values)
2 symnmf test_input_small8.txt (wrong output matrix values)
2 symnmf test_input1.txt (wrong output matrix values)
2 symnmf test_input4.txt (wrong output matrix values)
3 symnmf test_input8.txt (wrong output matrix values)
2 symnmf test_input12.txt (wrong output matrix values)
6 symnmf test_input16.txt (wrong output matrix values)
5 symnmf test_input20.txt (wrong output matrix values)
3 symnmf test_input24.txt (wrong output matrix values)
4 symnmf test_input28.txt (wrong output matrix values)
5 symnmf test_input32.txt (wrong output matrix values)
6 symnmf test_input36.txt (wrong output matrix values)

c failures:
ddg test_input6.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
norm test_input7.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
sym test_input13.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
sym test_input21.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
norm test_input23.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
ddg test_input26.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
sym test_input29.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
ddg test_input30.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
sym test_input33.txt (output is "An Error Has Occured")
(note that running "sym test_input9.txt", "ddg test_input22.txt" in c program works)
